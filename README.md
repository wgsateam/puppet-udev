Overview
--------

Manages the udev package and device rules


Description
-----------

This module installs and manages the
[`udev`](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/udev.html) package.


Usage
-----

### Simple

This class does not need to be manually included in the manifest when using the
`udev::rule` defined type.

```puppet
include udev
```

### Managing `udev` syslog verbosity

Controls the value of `udev_log` in `udev.conf` and change the runtime syslog
verbosity of the daemon.

```puppet
class { 'udev': udev_log => 'debug' }
```

### Managing `udev` rules

Note that either the `content` or `source` parameter must be specified unless
`ensure` is `absent`and that these parameters are mutually exclusive; you can
not specify both.

```puppet
udev::rule { '60-raw.rules':
  ensure  => present,
  content => 'ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sda", RUN+="/bin/raw /dev/raw/raw1 %N"',
}
```

As is commonly done with the `file` type, you can pass the output of the `template()` function to `content`.

```puppet
udev::rule { '99-foo.rules':
  ensure  => present,
  content => template('mymodule/foo.rules.erb'),
}
```

```puppet
udev::rule { '99-foo.rules':
  ensure  => present,
  source  => "puppet:///modules/${module_name}/foo.rules",
}
```

```puppet
udev::rule { '99-foo.rules':
  ensure  => absent,
}
```

Rules may also be created as a parameter off of the `udev` class

```puppet
class { 'udev':
  rules => { '99-foo.rules':
               ensure  => present,
               content => template('mymodule/foo.rules.erb'), }
}

```

### Manually triggering a `udev` device rules reload

```puppet
file { '/etc/etc/udev/rules.d/99-myfrobnicator.rules':
  ...
  notify => Class['udev::udevadm::trigger'],
}
```


Limitations
-----------

At present, only support for `$::osfamily == 'RedHat'` has been implemented.
Adding other Linux distributions should be trivial.

This module currently isn't using `puppetlabs-concat` for building up rule
files as that approach presents difficulties in being able to remove an empty
file (one without any fragments).

### Tested Platforms

* el6.x
* el5.x
* el7.x
* el8.x
* el9.x
* Debian/Ubuntu

### Puppet Version Compatibility

Versions | Puppet 2.7 | Puppet 3.x | Puppet 4.x | Puppet 5.x
:--------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:
**1.x**  | **yes**    | **yes**    | no         | no
**2.x**  | no         | **yes**    | **yes**    | **yes**

Please log tickets and issues at
[github](https://github.com/jhoblitt/puppet-udev/issues)


Contributing
------------

1. Fork it on github
2. Make a local clone of your fork
3. Create a topic branch.  Eg, `feature/mousetrap`
4. Make/commit changes
    * Commit messages should be in [imperative tense](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html)
    * Check that linter warnings or errors are not introduced - `bundle exec rake lint`
    * Check that `Rspec-puppet` unit tests are not broken and coverage is added for new
      features - `bundle exec rake spec`
    * Documentation of API/features is updated as appropriate in the README
    * If present, `beaker` acceptance tests should be run and potentially
      updated - `bundle exec rake beaker`
5. When the feature is complete, rebase / squash the branch history as
   necessary to remove "fix typo", "oops", "whitespace" and other trivial commits
6. Push the topic branch to github
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from the *topic branch* onto parent repo's `master` branch
